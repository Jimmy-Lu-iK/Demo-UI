<Story id="example-button--small" />

## Without the story title defined

If you didn't include the title in the story's default export, use this approach.

### Primary

<Story id="your-directory-button--primary"/>

### Secondary

<Story id="your-directory-button--secondary"/>

### Large

<Story id="your-directory-button--large"/>

### Small

<Story id="your-directory-button--small" />
